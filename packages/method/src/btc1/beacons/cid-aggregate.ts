 *
 * A Beacon of the type CIDAggregatoBeacon is a Beacon that publishes Bitcoin transactions containing a Content
 * Identifier (CID) announcing an Aggregated DID Update Bundle. An Aggregated DID Update Bundle is a JSON object that
 * maps did:btc1 identifiers to CID values for the individual DID Update Payloads. The Aggregated DID Update Bundle CID
 * (bundleCID) SHOULD be resolvable against a Content Addressable Storage (CAS) system such as IPFS, while the CID for
 * the DID Update Payload (payloadCID) MAY be resolvable against a CAS or provided through a Sidecar mechanism. It is
 * RECOMMENDED that this type of Beacon is only included in a DID document if the DID controller is REQUIRED to
 * participate in authorizing Bitcoin transactions from this Beacon. In other words, this Beacon SHOULD identify an
 * n-of-n P2TR Bitcoin address where n is the number of unique DID controllers submitting updates through the Beacon.

   * applicable for that identifier. Again this algorithm attempts to retrieve and validate the DID Update Payload
   * identified for the identifier being resolved. If successful, the DID Update Payload is returned.
   *
   * The Process CIDAggregate Beacon Signal algorithm is called by the Process Beacon Signals algorithm as part of the
   * Read operation.
   *
   * It takes as inputs a did:btc1 identifier, btc1Identifier, a Beacon Signal, tx, and a optional
   * object, signalSidecarData, containing any sidecar data provided to the resolver for the Beacon Signal identified by
   * the Bitcoin transaction identifier.

   * 5.2.1.1 Create CIDAggregate Beacon Advertisement
   * Any entity MAY act in the role of Beacon coordinator, creating a Beacon advertisement that they can broadcast across any medium. A Beacon advertisement specifies the properties of the Beacon that
   * the coordinator intends to establish, including the Beacon Type, cohort size, update frequency, and response latency. Once the advertisement has been created and broadcast, the coordinator waits
   * for enough participants to opt in before establishing the Beacon.
   *
   * 5.2.1.2 CIDAggregate Beacon Opt-in
   * DID controllers who wish to participate in a Beacon cohort first find potential Beacon advertisements that meet their needs. This includes checking the Beacon terms and update frequency, etc. If
   * satisfied, they create a secp256k1 cohort keypair and send an Opt-In request to the endpoint specified in the advertisement.
   *
   * 5.2.1.3 Cohort Set
   * Once a Beacon Aggregator has received enough opt-in responses from participants to satisfy the Beacon properties, they generate the n-of-n P2TR Bitcoin address for the Beacon. The address and all
   * the cohort public keys the address is constructed from are then sent to all participants in a CohortSet message.
   *
   * 5.2.1.4 Add Beacon Service Endpoint to DID Document
   * A participant receiving a CohortSet message first verifies their cohort key is included in the cohort, then calculates the P2TR Beacon address for themselves and verifies it matches the address
   * provided. They MAY wait until the Beacon address is funded before adding the Beacon as a service in the DID document. The following is an example of the Beacon service endpoint the DID controller
   * adds into their DID document, the Beacon address is converted into a URI following BIP21:
   * {
   *    "id": "#cidAggregateBeacon",
   *    "type": "CIDAggregateBeacon",
   *    "serviceEndpoint": "bitcoin:tb1pfdnyc8vxeca2zpsg365sn308dmrpka4e0n9c5axmp2nptdf7j6ts7eqhr8"
