 * provided along with a proof of inclusion against the SMT root through a Sidecar mechanism during resolution. Using
 * the SMT root a resolver can then verify the inclusion proof for the given DID Update Payload. If a DID document
 * includes a SMTAggregator Beacon in their set of Beacon services, then they MUST provide proofs for each signal that
 * the Beacon broadcasts. If they did not submit an update to their DID in a signal, then they MUST provide a proof of
 * non-inclusion for that signal.

   * A Beacon Signal from a SMTAggregate Beacon is a Bitcoin transaction with the first transaction output of the format
   * [OP_RETURN, OP_PUSH32, <32bytes>]. The 32 bytes of data contained within this transaction output represent the root
   * of a Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT). This SMT aggregates a set of hashes of DID Update payloads. In order to process
   * these Beacon Signals, the resolver MUST have been passed Sidecar data for this signal containing either the DID
   * Update payload object and a SMT proof that the hash of this object is in the SMT at the leaf indexed by the
   * did:btc1identifier being resolved. Or theSidecar data:: MUST contain a proof that the leaf indexed by the
   * did:btc1identifier is empty, thereby proving that theSMT:: does not contain an update for their identifier.
   *
   * The Process SMTAggregate Beacon Signal is called by the Process Beacon Signals algorithm as part of the Read
   * operation. It takes as inputs a did:btc1 identifier, btc1Identifier, a Beacon Signal, tx, and a optional object,
   * signalSidecarData, containing any sidecar data provided to the resolver for the Beacon Signal identified by the
   * Bitcoin transaction identifier.
   *
   * It returns the DID Update payload announced by the Beacon Signal for the did:btc1 identifier being resolved or
   * throws an error.
   *
   * @param {RawTransactionV2} signal The raw transaction signal.
