/**
 * Implements {@link https://dcdpr.github.io/did-btc1/#update-beacons | 5. Beacons}.
 * Beacons are the mechanism by which a DID controller announces an update to their DID document by broadcasting an
 * attestation to this update onto the public Bitcoin network. Beacons are identified by a Bitcoin address and emit
 * Beacon Signals by broadcasting a valid Bitcoin transaction that spends from this Beacon address. These transactions
 * include attestations to a set of didUpdatePayloads, either in the form of Content Identifiers (CIDs) or Sparse Merkle
 * Tree (SMT) roots. Beacons are included as a service in DID documents, with the Service Endpoint identifying a Bitcoin
 * address to watch for Beacon Signals. All Beacon Signals broadcast from this Beacon MUST be processed as part of
 * resolution (see Read). The type of the Beacon service in the DID document defines how Beacon Signals SHOULD be
 * processed.
 * did:btc1 supports different Beacon Types, with each type defining a set of algorithms for:
 *  1. How a Beacon can be established and added as a service to a DID document.
 *  2. How attestations to DID updates are broadcast within Beacon Signals.
 *  3. How a resolver processes a Beacon Signal, identifying, verifying, and applying the authorized mutations to a
 *     DID document for a specific DID.
 * This is an extendable mechanism, such that in the future new Beacon Types could be added. It would be up to the
 * resolver to determine if the Beacon Type is a mechanism they support and are willing to trust. If they are unable to
 * support a Beacon Type and a DID they are resolving uses that type then the DID MUST be treated as invalid.
 * The current, active Beacons of a DID document are specified in the documentâ€™s service property. By updating the DID
 * document, a DID controller can change the set of Beacons they can use to broadcast updates to their DID document over
 * time. Resolution of a DID MUST process signals from all Beacons identified in the latest DID document and apply them
 * in order determined by the version specified by the didUpdatePayload.
 * All resolvers of did:btc1 DIDs MUST support the core Beacon Types defined in this specification.
